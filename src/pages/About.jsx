          ...or, you can call me Xijei (my IGN ðŸŽ®). I'm a Software Developer based in Baler, Aurora. Passionate about building web applications that are performant, accessible and have a great user experience. I love learning so I'm always keeping up to date by doing random side projects , watching conference talks, listening to podcasts and reading blog posts.

          My coding journey started unexpectedly in my second year of high school way back in 2013.
          I went to university and took Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. In our first year we had to build a basic
          website and I thought writing code was so cool. I was hooked so and continued my studies.
          I graduated in 2019 with an honour and starte working in the industry after my graduation.
